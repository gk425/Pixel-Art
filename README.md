# Pixel-Art
## Introduction
The program will create a GUI program that allows the user to create simple pixel art, using the turtle module. The program will provide a grid of 20-by-20 squares that are 20 pixels long, color in the square that the user clicks on, and let the user change the color.

## Features
1. There is a color palette. Left-clicking on a square of the color palette correctly changes the fill color for the canvas squares. The color remains the same until the next time the user clicks on a square of the color palette.
2. Right-clicking on a square is an eraser.
3. When the user left-clicks on a "Show Art" button, the canvas picture is rendered below on a smaller scale (each canvas square corresponding to a 2-by-2 pixel square of the same color, and in the same position)
